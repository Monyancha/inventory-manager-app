---

--> This project was part of the "Databases" course (Project #10 of the program).

--> The goal was to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app was expected to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It was also required to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

--> Project specifications can be found [here](documentation/udacity-abn-inventory-manager-app-specifications.pdf).
